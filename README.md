Hi I'm Tarick Ali, but most people call me either Rick or Ricky. I study computer science and combinatorics & optimization at the University of Waterloo with an emphasis on theoretical mathematics. I am and have always been interested in artificial intelligence, especially in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.

Currently, I am working on some mystery projects that I hope to slowly reveal as they are completed.

Since these projects are pretty massive in scale, if you'd like to contribute to these mystery projects you can reach me at notmysteryrick@gmail.com.
